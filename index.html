                    <p>We followed her out of the sashimi restaurant (which was incredible) and walked towards the car park. Amongst all the cars parked up I noticed a beautiful brand new German sports car.</p>
                    <p>"Hah, and this is yours - I'm guessing?"</p>
                    <p>"Yup, that's right"</p>
                    <p>And that's when I realised we'd all grown up a bit since 2009.</p>
                    <p>We met when we were both studying at Fudan university in Shanghai. I was 19. 15 years later, she hasn't aged a bit (Korean skincare is no joke) and she has made it big in the fashion industry.</p>
                    <p>A few weeks prior, I had been in New York on a work trip, and had arranged to meet up with two friends who live there. One of my friends had asked if he could bring "a friend" who happened to be visiting New York at the same time. My first "holy shit" moment in a while, that was the first time we'd seen eachother in over 15 years.</p>
                    <p>And now, soon after, we were in Seoul. I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to this three-month excursion.</p>
                    <div class="photo-container">
                        <img class="photo" src="img/seoul/2.jpg"/>

                    <p>The jet lag was brutal. The hotel room was tiny. The bed was hard. I slept like crap. The first night we left the window ajar, and I awoke to a wall covered in mosquitos. In a mad 5am fit of rage I folded a piece of paper and hunted them down in my underwear one by one, leaving little blood stains all over the wall (of which the AirBnB owner has fortunately mentioned nothing). It took a while to acclimatise, but Seoul was awesome. The food is ridiculous. The people are very welcoming. We visited night markets, ate fried chicken, dropped in to Korean BBQs.</p>

                    <p>Life continues as normal but there are constant reminders about being close to the border. Literally, reminders. During our stay we received regular daily public security announcements on our phones that the North Korean government was sending trash balloons over the border. We decided to take a trip to the DMZ to check it out. The injustice in that moment was stark, that we and South Koreans enjoy relative prosperity whilst people starve mere miles away. Peace feels far away: a few people we met mentioned that they didn't want reunification, given the economic toll it would take on the country. The North Korean government has abandoned the idea, considering the South Korean government an economy. A week after we left, they blew up the main road connecting the two countries, the same road which their sports teams had taken to participate in the South Korean world cup in 2002.</p>

                    On our last days we hiked up to the various mountains in the city, and managed to catch a huge firework display. Seoul was great. I hope to come back.

                    <p>Next we arrived in Gyeongju. A historical city, we took some time to explore the tombs scattered throughout. We ate a ton of slow-cooked pork and beef. Then, we found a really nice cocktail bar and drank shots with the owners.</p>

                    <p>After this brief excursion we made our way to Busan for a few days. I liked it. It felt like a real coastal city, a bit more chill than Seoul. But it also felt a lot less prosperous, and it was somewhat clear to me that all of the wealth was concentrated in the capital. I later read that it is indeed a country like in the UK, which is overly reliant on its capital city for econimic growth.</p>
                    <p>Another thing I noticed was just how many old people there were, and the lack of children. This confirmed another trend that I was aware of that, that is that South Korea has the lowest birth rate in the world.</p>
                    <p>We then made our way to the port. We got on the ferry bound to Fukuoka, only to realise that we'd accidentally booked the lowest class, instead of the comfy bed I was expecting. With a wooden block wrapped in leather as my pillow, I tried to get a few hours of sleep. I failed.</p>

                        "That's not true!" I exclaimed late into the evening, inspired by several cups of sake in quick succession.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "No, really - over 7000 years." he affirmed with a smile, as he poured us another glass.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I checked online. He was right. Yakushima is the home to cedar trees, known as Yakusugi, which are thought to have been there over 2000 years before our ancestors built the pyramids. They pre-date Jesus. The middle ages. The renaissance. During the chaos of history they were presumably able to find some refuge on this tiny tropical island from civilisation and, relatively undisturbed, permitted to grow to goliath proportions.
                    </p>
                    <div class="photo-container">
                        <img class="photo" src="img/yakushima/1.jpg"/>
                        <img class="photo" src="img/yakushima/7.jpg"/>
                        <img class="photo" src="img/yakushima/9.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        We found ourselves, our first night in Yakushima, the only two customers at the small bar of an old Japanese jazzman who had fled 30 years prior from the mainland. The room was dimly lit, with only a handful of low-hanging pendulum lamps illumating the bar at which we sat, reflecting the light gently off his tired face on the other side. In the background played some old jazz tunes. He had moved here to be closer to nature, and had even built his home with his own hands deep in the forest. Having lived for five years in the 80s in New York to work as a jazz musician, he spoke English well, but with a thick Japanese accent in a low, rough voice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "I've named five waterfalls here myself. Most of the waterfalls on this island don't have names."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And again, he was right. The waterfalls are everywhere. But it's not surprising. It rained every single day of our four-day stay in Yakushima. The island is beautiful yet unwelcoming, the mountain ominously veiled most of the time by a thick black cloud, which only on occasion dispersed and granted a teasing glimpse, yet ostensibly always capable of pulling the rug from under your feet once you decide to ascend into it. Our first day, we learned this the hard way, shivering and waiting for the bus after a four-hour hike, our "waterproof" clothing dragging us down, saturated with rainwater.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, I enjoyed Yakushima. The lush, green forests are genuinely something I have not seen back at home in Switzerland. The locals are extremely accommodating. The food is delicious. Monkeys and deer roam the island, seemingly unperturbed by humans. I get the hype.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it's not an easy destination to visit. Getting there takes time. It's not cheap. A car is a requirement. Businesses only open for a few days each day.
