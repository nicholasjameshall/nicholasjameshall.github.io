                    <p>My goal by the end of these two months is to learn to solo over jazz tracks with more than just a pentatonic. I chose this goal for the following reasons, in order of importance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's cool</li>
                        <li>It seems to unlock a lot of other things on guitar. Learning the role of specific chords in progressions, the use of arpeggios, and scales are the fundamental building blocks of most music on guitar. If I have the ability to do this, it should make a lot of other things relatively simple in comparison.</li>
                        <li>I like George Benson</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>My strategy will be the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pick a song</li>
                        <li>Learn the chords</li>
                        <li>Learn the melody</li>
                        <li>Learn the arpeggios</li>
                        <li>Transcribe parts of the solo I like</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At roughly an hour per day, I will aim to learn one song every two weeks, increasing to one song per week as the chords and arpeggios become more familiar. I'll post content and videos here to keep myself accountable.</p>
                    <p>Since we're travelling light, I brought my cavaquinho, and tuned it in the Portuguese style, which is to DGBE - the highest four strings of a guitar in standard tuning. Hopefully this will somewhat translate to guitar once I return :)</p>

                    <p>I like this song because it's not too complex, and it's beautiful. I was quite inspired by videos such as <a href="https://youtu.be/pX6Qk38t5g0">this one</a> which I find super cool.</p> The song is in the key of E minor, you actually can just solo over the entire thing in E minor pentatonic and it sounds good, but I want to go further and learn the arpeggios and incorporate some jazz phrasing.</p>
                    <h2>Chords</h2>
                    <p>The diatonic chords of E minor are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>i: Emin</li>
                        <li>iiÂ°: F#dim</li>
                        <li>III: Gmaj</li>
                        <li>iv: Amin</li>
                        <li>v: Bmin</li>
                        <li>VI: Cmaj</li>
                        <li>VII: Dmaj</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The chords and their respective degrees are the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Em7: i</li>
                        <li>G9: not a diatonic chord in Emin, but a secondary dominant of CMaj7 (VI)</li>
                        <li>CMaj7: VI</li>
                        <li>F#min7: not sure</li>
                        <li>B7: V</li>
                        <li>F9: tritone substitution of B7 (<a href="https://www.apassion4jazz.net/tritone.html">useful table</a>). Essentially this works because both chords share the same 3rd and flat 7th notes. The 3rd interval of Bmaj is D#, which is the flat 7th degree of Fmaj (Eb). Likewise, the 3rd interval of Fmaj is A, which is the flat 7th interval of Bmaj. In this case, I'm playing F9 (which adds the 9th scale degree on top of the F7).</li>
                        <li>F#7sus4: no idea</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Melody</h2>
                    <p>The melody is pretty simple.</p>
                    <h2>Arpeggios</h2>
                    <p>
                        Next, I need to know which arpeggios to play. On cavaquinho this is quite tricky, because you don't actually
                        have a lot of usable notes. Pretty much anything above the 7th fret is tricky and preferably avoidable. This 
                        forces you to think in terms of inversions, since you are limited by which root note you can use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, you might want to play c major over the Cmaj7 chord. However, C is at the 10th and 5th frets of the D and G strings respectively. It can be helpful to think modally. For example, we could instead use the natural minor (same notes) from two frets down (8th and 3rd). This contains the same notes (ACEG). Likewise, we can also play E phrygian 8 frets down (from 2nd or 9th), or G mixolydian 5 frets down (5th or open).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, in order:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Em7: E minor melodic (from 2nd fret D string)</li>
                        <li>G9: Ab minor melodic (from 1st fret G string)</li>
                        <li>CMaj7: E phrygian (from 2nd fret D string)</li>
                        <li>F#min7: not sure</li>
                        <li>B7: B mixolydian (from 4th fret G string)</li>
                        <li>F9: F mixolydian (from 3rd fret F string)</li>
                        <li>F#7sus4: no idea</li>
                    </ul>
